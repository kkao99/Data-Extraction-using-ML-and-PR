## Current State of Play

Converting unstructured data into structure data is at the basis of cognitive automation. Generally we receive a large variety of data set from our clients in different formats and shapes. Ultimately for humans or robotic processes to take action, relevant information must be extracted and organized


## About the Project

In this project, we are able to convert an unstructured pdf into an organized set of data. We then apply machine learning to train the model that can best the extract data.
